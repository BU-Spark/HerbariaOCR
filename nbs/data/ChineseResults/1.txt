To provide the relevant information in a JSON format according to the Darwin Core standard, I'll extract details from the text provided. Although the text provided is quite limited and partially unclear, I will put together the information as best as I can:

- `NÂº 1741933` is likely the specimen or catalog number.
- `Clerodendrum japonicum (Thunb.) Sweet` appears to be what is indicated by "Caliarpa girakai," which seems like a misspelling or an old synonym for the species. As it was not possible to confirm 'Caliarpa girakai' as a recognized species name in any biodiversity database, we will use the legitimate species name for Clerodendrum japonicum.
- `Have is Ribe.` is not clear, but it possibly refers to a location or collector, which unfortunately cannot be interpreted without further context.
- `4 5.` is ambiguous and does not relate to any standard Darwin Core field without additional context.
- The date `1817-7-3` represents the event date on which the specimen was collected or observed.

Since we do not have explicit information about the country, based on the genus `Clerodendrum` which is native to many regions including Asia, and because there was Chinese text mentioned (though not provided), we might infer the country to be China for this entry.

Here is the information in JSON format. Note that some fields remain empty ("") because the provided text does not contain this information, and I do not want to assume data which could be inaccurate.

```json
{
  "occurrenceID": "1741933",
  "scientificName": "Clerodendrum japonicum (Thunb.) Sweet",
  "eventDate": "1817-07-03",
  "country": "China",
  "recordedBy": "",
  "locality": "",
  "decimalLatitude": "",
  "decimalLongitude": "",
  "coordinateUncertaintyInMeters": "",
  "identificationQualifier": "",
  "taxonRank": "",
  "institutionCode": "",
  "collectionCode": "",
  "basisOfRecord": ""
}
```

Without further information, we cannot accurately fill out the remaining Darwin Core fields. Additional context would allow for a more complete and accurate JSON representation.
