As an AI language model, I can process and extract information provided I have the text to work with. Since you haven't provided the actual text containing information about a biodiversity specimen that I am supposed to process, I can't generate a Darwin Core JSON object with the relevant information.

Could you please provide the text containing the details of the biodiversity specimen? With the actual specimen information, I can then help you by returning the relevant details organized according to the Darwin Core standard in JSON format.
