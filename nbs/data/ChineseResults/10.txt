Based on the information provided, it seems that there might be an attempt to format data according to the Darwin Core standard, which is a framework for sharing biodiversity information. However, the information given is quite limited and lacks context. From what is provided, I will extract the bits of information that could potentially fit into Darwin Core fields. Given the term "FUICIEN" which seems to be a misspelling, I am assuming it might be "FUJIAN" â€” which is a province in China. Therefore, the country can be inferred as "China".

Here's a JSON representation of the fragment of information based on the Darwin Core standard:

```json
{
  "catalogNumber": "1364939",
  "recordNumber": "1817-7-2",
  "country": "China",
  "fieldNumber": "174"
}
```

Important details related to common Darwin Core fields such as `scientificName`, `decimalLatitude`, `decimalLongitude`, `eventDate`, `family`, `genus`, etc. are not present in the text snippet you have provided. If these details are available, they could be added to the JSON object to conform more completely to the Darwin Core standard. 

In this scenario, `catalogNumber` is used as it typically refers to the unique identifier for the specimen in a collection, `recordNumber` might represent the field record number associated with the collection event, and `fieldNumber` is assumed to be an additional identifier used in the field. However, these are educated guesses based on usual museum and herbarium practices and the limited context provided.
