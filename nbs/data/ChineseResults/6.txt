Based on the provided text, it appears to be a record of a biological specimen but the information is incomplete and somewhat fragmented. In Darwin Core, we'd need to standardize this information into a format recognizable by biodiversity databases. Below is the information in JSON format to the best interpretation of the given text:

```json
{
  "institutionCode": "中国药学院就和研究所",
  "collectionCode": "植物吉本室 標本室",
  "catalogNumber": "1213821",
  "scientificName": "Anacardiairar",
  "recordedBy": "M",
  "recordNumber": "45",
  "eventDate": "1817-07-02",
  "country": "中国"
}
```

Please note that I interpreted "中国药学院就和研究所 植物吉本室" as a combination of the institution code and collection code. "標本室" (specimen room) may refer to the physical location where the specimen is stored within the institution. "M" is recorded in the `recordedBy` field, possibly referring to the person or team identifier who collected the specimen, although traditionally a full name is provided. The date "1817-7-2" is formatted to ISO 8601 standard as "1817-07-02". Finally, the country is inferred as "中国" (China) from the text, and I converted "Anacardiairar" directly as it appears to be a misspelling or incomplete scientific name – possibly referring to a genus in the Anacardiaceae family.

Please note that the quality of this JSON representation is entirely dependent on the accuracy and completeness of the input provided. In a real-world context, the verbatim scientific name should be verified and possibly corrected to a valid taxonomic name. Similarly, additional fields would be filled in given a more complete record, including specific locality, coordinates, and other relevant Darwin Core terms.
