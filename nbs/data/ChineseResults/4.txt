Based on the information provided and using the Darwin Core (DwC) standard, which is a framework intended to provide a stable, robust, and flexible reference to share information about biological diversity, here's how the information could be structured in JSON format:

```json
{
  "institutionCode": "中国科学校区用植物研究所",
  "collectionCode": "蝶态室",
  "catalogNumber": "0973767",
  "scientificName": "Saarmia oistyla",
  "recordNumber": "DK- 4",
  "eventDate": "2073-7-1",
  "country": "China",
  "basisOfRecord": "PreservedSpecimen",
  "locality": "北国"
}
```

Explanation of fields:

- `institutionCode`: The code or name of the institution where the record is held, which appears to be "中国科学校区用植物研究所" (likely "Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences" or a similar institution).
- `collectionCode`: The name or code denoting the collection or dataset within the institution, which is identified as "蝶态室" (butterfly room or section within the institution).
- `catalogNumber`: A unique identifier for the record within the collection, which is "0973767".
- `scientificName`: The scientific name of the organism in the standard format of genus followed by species, which in this case is "Saarmia oistyla".
- `recordNumber`: A unique identifier assigned by the collector(s) or observer(s), which seems to be represented by "DK- 4".
- `eventDate`: The date the specimen was collected or observed, which is mentioned as "2073-7-1". However, it should be noted that this future date seems incorrect or typographical error and may need to be verified.
- `country`: The country where the specimen was collected. As the text includes Chinese characters and the institution appears to be in China, it is inferred that the country is "China".
- `basisOfRecord`: The specific nature of the data record - a preserved specimen in this case.
- `locality`: The specific place where the organism was found or collected, referred to as "北国" which translates to "northern country", yet this is rather vague and it's unclear exactly which locality this refers to within China.

Note: The fields are based on the Darwin Core terms and some assumptions and interpretations of the text provided. Parts of the text are unclear or incomplete; for example, "15元" might refer to a price, fee, or something else entirely but does not fit within the standard Darwin Core fields. Additionally, the date "2073-7-1" appears to be an error, as it's a date in the future from the current knowledge cutoff.
