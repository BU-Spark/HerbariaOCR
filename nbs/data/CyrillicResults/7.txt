The text provided contains very limited information in a mix of Cyrillic, numeric and Latin characters. I will attempt to extract the relevant data in accordance to the Darwin Core (DwC) standard for a biodiversity specimen record to the best of my ability given the text provided.

- `Herbarium Univ. Mosquensis` can be interpreted as the name of the herbarium where the specimen is stored, which would translate to "Herbarium of Moscow University". This indicates that the country is likely Russia or a Russian speaking country.
- `MW 0 019 858` appears to be a catalog or accession number for the specimen.
- The date `24-VII-1955` is likely the collection date of the specimen, formatted as day-month-year.
- `J. Tpocent` is possibly the collector's name, though the spelling may be phonetic or incorrectly transcribed.

Given the unclear text and the lack of scientific names, locations, or other typical Darwin Core fields, the resulting JSON would contain a number of null or assumed fields, filled only with the information that can be sensibly deduced:

```json
{
  "institutionCode": "Herbarium Univ. Mosquensis",
  "catalogNumber": "MW 0 019 858",
  "country": "Russia",
  "eventDate": "1955-07-24",
  "recordedBy": "J. Tpocent",
  "basisOfRecord": "PreservedSpecimen"
}
```

Note that `basisOfRecord` is assumed to be `PreservedSpecimen` given the context of a herbarium which typically stores preserved plant specimens. The rest of the text does not provide clear, usable data for the JSON output. If additional reliable information could be obtained from the text, it should be included in the JSON structure following the appropriate Darwin Core terms.
